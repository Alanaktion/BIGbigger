        <q>
            Ever since I was very young I wanted to open up a bakery. I've always enjoyed baking, and friends and family have told
            me for a long time they and others would be happy to pay for a batch of my fresh cookies. But being a baker doesn't
            suddenly make you a good business person. Thankfully, I brought the few ideas I had to BIGbigger, and they helped fill
            in the blanks. I am now living my dream of doing what I love and supporting myself and family with it.
